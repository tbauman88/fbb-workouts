Your optimal grip width should consider individual shoulder comfort, which varies among people. A wider grip provides a deeper stretch to the pectoral muscles, with more emphasis on them. Conversely, a closer grip emphasizes triceps engagement. Pay attention to post-bench soreness to guide grip adjustments in the coming weeks.\n",
